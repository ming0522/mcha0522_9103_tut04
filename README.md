## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

For my final assignment, I chose Entangled (2015) by digital artist Camille Utterback as my inspiration. In this installation, participants engage with imagery projected onto both sides of translucent scrims, suspended in the center of the space. Movements in the interactive zones on either side trigger the imagery to appear, shift, and fade on the respective projection. I believe Camilleâ€™s work offers valuable insight into how altering input methods can deepen participant interaction. By capturing their body movements, her installation produces varied visual effects, transforming participants into both audience and creators, which is very inspiring.
